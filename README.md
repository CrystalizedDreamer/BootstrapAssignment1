Bootstrap Assignment performed under the care of CodingTemple

Good Evening,

Now then, this assignment was designed to test the student in integrating bootstrap into their work.
At first, it was a little bit foreign, as I wanted to know if custom css was compatible with bootstrap (hint, yes it is very much so)

I had a bit of fun at the beginning of the project  because I began working under bootstrap library 3.4 and wound up needing to switch to the 5.0 library when I realized certain 
features were not working properly.

Inside the index file, my attempts to practice the codes at first are commented out. 
while I realize that the point of bootstrap is needed to make the process simpler, but I wanted to understand the process that went into it a bit better.
While certain fragments of code were pulled directly as boilerplate, a few were made by hand just to make sure I could better understand
the logic that governs the bootstrap framework.

I spent a good amount of time tinkering with the code to try to better understand it. 
but it seems simple enough:

Want an element to display a certain way? Assign it the class that describes what you want it to look like.

In this assignment, I was expected to create

-A Navbar that collapses into a hamburger menu below a certain breakpoint
(I chose a darker aesthetic as well, given the rising consumer preference towards this stylization)

-A table with hardcoded data for an example

-A form to collect user information, specifically one in which the user's first and last names REMAIN on the same line regardless of screen size.

-Two or more images,  One responsive to screen size and a circular image.

-Two buttons, one that is always visible and another that disappears on a small screen size

These requirements were completed to the best of my abilities and knowledge at this point in time.
I now proceed to other assignments to maintain my pacing in the class.
